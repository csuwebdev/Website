T-Shirts - We will put your brand name on the T-shirts. We will all wear our t-shirts at events and meetings resulting in your brand name being visible to tons of Computer Scientists and public. 

Events - Our first event we will be teaching our members how to host a web server. We would like to purchase and set up a server as a group that we will then use to provide free hosting to the club members during their time with the club. 

Domain names - We also would like to host development competitions where we reward the winner with a domain name. This will be an easy way to help motivate our members to apply their new skills.

Chromebooks - Most of our members don't have laptops, and we don't have access to computers. Our lectures would be much more interactive and effective if we could build up a small inventory of laptops that we can provide to members on a weekly or daily "lease"

We are building forums and tutorials on our website www.csuwebdev.com and we expect to become a useful online resource for learning web development. With your donation it would be awesome to have some sort of page dedicated to you as our sponsor.

                        <p class="PostParagraph">Welcome to the club we hope that you will make friends and learn during your time here. Every week you will receive a newsletter if you attend the club. This newsletter will slowly expose our vision for the club, and the goals we have for our members development. It will have information we consider to be vital to success, but not relevant to talk about during club meetings. Also contained will be the priorities we are working on internally to improve the club for everyone involved. Please contact one of the club officers if you are willing to help out in the areas listed.</p>
                        <h3  class="PostHeader">Our Vision for you</h3>
                        <p class="PostParagraph">Many of us will be on campus for a year or more. We want to help you launch a personal website if you don't have one. After that we want to continually help you improve your website by giving you code examples and ideas. Finally, we want you to work with others on projects larger in scope than something personal. Keep in mind that the most important part of being a club member is working on your own website. Working on your own website exposes you to the excitement that makes web development fun. You will inadvertently come up with new ideas and visions for your own projects, and we hope that you will share them with us at club meetings.</p>
                        <h3  class="PostHeader">Our Vision for the Club</h3>
                        <p class="PostParagraph">We would like to develop and maintain a website for the club that showcases the skills of the people involved. A small group will be selected to help develop and add features to the club website. During the club meetings this group will focus on implementing the discussed feature on our club website. Eventually we hope that this website will have features such as accounts for the club members, achievements, elegant design, credits on the website, games, blogs, chat systems, forum, Q & A section, and any other suggestions you would like to see or help implement.</p>

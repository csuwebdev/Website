<h2>Meetings every Thursday in Langdon 104 at 4:00PM</h3>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>We started in Fall 2013 with the goal of helping our members become better web developers. This includes helping them build their own websites, and collaborating with other members on bigger projects. Meeting topics include HTML , CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. One of the big focuses is sending members home with example code that can be applied to any website. Weekly newsletters provide information on club events, important skills to develop as a web designer, and more. </p>
